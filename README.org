* Literate Configuration
There's an attempt to turn my entire configuration into a literate one.
** Rationale
- Write documentation, not comments.
- Split the configuration into sensible modules.
** Pros
- ~org-mode~ navigation of one configuration file.
- Configure the ~extraCongif~ argument in the correct language.
- Break-down any configuration.
- Enable disabling of code with comments or removing them.
** Cons
- Requires knowledge of ~org-mode~.
- Requires an initial time investment to setup.
- Mistakes could be made in the ~:tangle~ header argument.
** Steps
- [X] Move everything in ~./modules~ to ~modules.org~.
- [X] Move ~modules.org~ to ~nixos.org~.
- [X] Move ~configuration.nix~ to ~nixos.org~.
- [ ] Move ~flake.nix~ to ~nixos.org~.
- [ ] Move ~home.nix~ to ~nixos.org~.

* TODO Usage
** NixOS as a Desktop
** Development in Nix Flakes
** Development in Distrobox

* Future Concerns
Concerns for topics that are more than one year away. These do not affect the
current configuration.
** VFIO
In the future I want to build a PC with the goal of VFIO passthrough, I have
found a few guides but have not tested any myself.

If I can't make it work I'll just dual boot with Windows.

*** Last Resort
- [ ] Can this be done with ~virt-manager~ installed inside an Arch Linux ~distrobox~?
